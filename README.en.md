## Instructions

You will need [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer.

Having it, just go open a terminal and navigate to the folder where
this exploit is. First you need to load the dependencies of the script:

```bash
npm install
```

After this you can run it:

```bash
npm start
```

It will ask the URL of the backend. It must start with `wss://`
or `ws://`, after clicking on "Analize" it will connect to the
websocket and start analysing it. If the server is vulnerable you
will see the messages going through it in realtime.
